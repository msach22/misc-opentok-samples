# OpenTok Link-Based Conversation Starter Kit

An OpenTok 1-to-1 solution focussed on web meetings shared with links

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.

2. Save a copy of `config.ini.sample` with the name `config.ini`.

3. Set the following variables in the `config.ini` file:

   * `OPENTOK_KEY` and `OPENTOK_SECRET` -- Set these to your OpenTok API key and
     API secret values from the [TokBox Dashboard](https://dashboard.tokbox.com).

   * `MYSQL_URL` -- This is the URL for access to your MySQL server. The format is
     `mysql://username:password@mysqlurl:port/database_name`.

4. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

5. Use Composer to install dependencies:

        composer install

6. Set the document root for your web server (such as Apache, nginx, etc.) to the `web` directory
   of this project. In the case of Apache, the provided `.htaccess` file handles URL rewriting.
   See the [Slim Route URL Rewriting Guide](http://docs.slimframework.com/#Route-URL-Rewriting)
   for more details.

## Usage

1. Visit the URL mapped to the application by your web server.

2. Enter a name for the chat room.

3. Share the URL with a friend and you will get a 1-1 chat session.

## Requirements

* PHP
* MySQL

## Code and Conceptual Walkthrough

### Server

* All server code is located in `index.php`.

* `index.php` starts off by creating and connecting to the database and table required for the app.

* Rooms table:

  * Name -- the room name

  * Sessionid - The OpenTok session ID that the users will connect to

  * User1 - The timestamp of user1's heartbeat to see if user1 is still connected to the room

  * User2 - The timestamp of user2's heartbeat to see if user2 is still connected to the room

* All the end points are created in `index.php`.

### Interaction

* A user starts by going to the root URL, and `index.php` renders `templates/createRoom.php`.

* `createRoom.php` contains a form in which the user enters the name of the room they want to join.

  * Styling for `createRoom.php` is located in `assets/css/createRoom.css`.

  * The JavaScript code for `createRoom.php`is located in `assets/js/createRoom.js`.

    * When the user presses the Enter key, the user is sent to the `/roomname` endpoint in
      `index.php`.

      * `/:roomname` attempts to retrieve the room from the table.

        * If the room does not exist, the code creates an OpenTok session ID for that room and
          stores the room name and session ID in the table.

        * If the room exists, the code checks if the user1 and user2 column timestamps are within
          60 seconds of current time. If it is, that means there are already 2 people in the room
          currently, and the "Room is full message" is displayed.

        * If the room is available, the code stores the user ID (user1 or user2) in the data of the
          OpenTok token so we can identify the users later. The page renders `templates/chat.php`.

* `chat.php` renders the view of the video chat room.

  * When the user connects to the OpenTok session, the page gets the user ID (user1 or user2), which
    was encoded into the token, by checking the `session.connection.data` property.

  * `heartBeatTimeout` sends a post request to the `/:sessionid` endpoint in `index.php` with the
     user ID.

  * `index.php` retrieves the room based on the session ID and updates the userId with the current
    timestamp.

## Appendix -- Deploying to Heroku

Heroku is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that you can use to deploy simple and small applications
for free. For that reason, you may choose to experiment with this code and deploy it using
Heroku.

The provided `Procfile` describes a web process that launches this application.

This application uses MYSQL. Follow [heroku addons:add cleardb:ignite](these instructions) to
install the ClearDB add-on for Heroku to use MYSQL.

Use Heroku config to set the following keys:

*  `OPENTOK_KEY` -- Your OpenTok API key

*  `OPENTOK_SECRET` -- Your OpenTok API secret

*  `MYSQL_URL` -- Your ClearDB URL when you added the
   [ClearDB add-on](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cleardb) for Heroku.
